available publically via api.usaspending.gov or posted in dataworld.

Instructions:
1. Download the dataset "tas_categories.csv" from data.world and save the file
2. Download the R script
3. Open R Studio

   A file can be opened by selecting 'File' > 'Open File' > Select the file location, and select open or
   by using the file open icon
5. Set the correct working directory, this will designate the location for the dataset input and graph output
   
   Go to line 25 and enter the file location following the first open parentheses in "setwd()"
   
   This should point to the folder location to which the dataset is saved
